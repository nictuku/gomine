gomine is a mod (server wrapper) for minecraft, written in Go.

Current features:
- Update the server's twitter status when a user connects.
- Public command: /twit <msg>
    ~ Let users keep a twitter journal of their minecraft adventures. The
      message is posted by the server's twitter account.

gomine was inspired by tztk[1], a cool mod written in Perl.
